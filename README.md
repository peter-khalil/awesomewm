# AwesomeWM

This is my own configuration files for AwesomeWM.
Awesome is a dynamic tiling window manager (TWM) that's based on DWN.

I used Awesome for a while, and it was really good.
But, due to some problems related to the functionality, I left it for a manual tiling window manager -- i3WM/Sway.

Here, I will share my configuration and theming files.
After downloading the files, you are free to use & edit it the way you like.
